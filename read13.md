What is Active Directory?

What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides?t is used to authenticate users and to control access to network resources. A server running AD DS is called a domain controller. Most Windows domain networks have two or more domain controllers; a primary domain controller and one or more backup domain controllers for resiliency.

What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory?A domain is a collection of objects (e.g. users, devices) that share the same Active Directory database. A domain is identified by a DNS name like company.com.
A tree is a collection of one or more domains with a contiguous namespace (they have a common DNS root name like marketing.company.com, engineering.company.com, and sales.company.com).
A forest is a collection of one or more trees that share a common schema, global catalog, and directory configuration—but aren’t part of a contiguous namespace. The forest typically serves as the security boundary for an enterprise network.

How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped?

Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member.
