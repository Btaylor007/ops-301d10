Layers of OSI Model

What does “OSI” stand for?
List the 7 layers of the OSI model and what each one is responsible for.
Distinguish which layers are the “hardware layers”, and which layers are the “software layers”. What does that even mean?
How can the OSI model be used in troubleshooting?
What Is Wireshark and How Is It Used?

Feel free to stop at “How to Use Wireshark”
What is Wireshark? Wireshark is a widely used network protocol analyzer. It is an open-source software that allows users to analyze and troubleshoot the interactions between different components in a network. Wireshark can capture and display the data traveling back and forth on a network in real-time.
What is a packet? 
A packet is a basic unit of data in computer networking. It is a formatted block of data that includes both the data being transmitted and control information for routing and error checking. When data is sent over a network, it is divided into smaller packets for efficient transmission.
What 3 high-level things does Wireshark accomplish? How could these be used for nefarious purposes? For benevolent purposes? Packet Capture and Analysis:
